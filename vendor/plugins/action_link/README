= ActionLink

ActionLink is a helper that simplifies displaying stateful navigation links. State 
depends on current controller and action.

= Installation

script/plugin install git://github.com/gzigzigzeo/action_link.git

Copy app/helpers/action_link_helper.rb from plugin's folder to your app 
folder if you have Rails <2.3

= Examples

Let we have RESTful PostsController and two navigation links in layout. 

  layouts/application.html.erb
    <ul>
      <li>
        <%= link_to "Posts", posts_url %>
        <ul>
          <li><%= link_to "New post", new_post_url %></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

So, at every page we have same links. But in good form we should mark
current user location by changing visual appearance of current and parent navigation
links. For example, if user opens new post page, "New post" should be displayed
as regular text, and "Posts" should become bold.

Solution:

  posts_controller.rb

    class PostsController < ApplicationController
      helper :action_link
    end

  application_helper.rb

    module ApplicationHelper
      def navigation_link(label, active, chosen, url)
        state = action_state(active, chosen)

        content_tag :li do
          case state
          when :inactive
            link_to label, url
          when :active
            label
          when :chosen
            content_tag(:b, link_to(label, url))
          end
        end
      end
    end

  layouts/application.html.erb

    <ul>
      <li>
        <%= navigation_link("Posts", "posts/index", "posts/*", posts_url) %>
        <ul>
          <%= navigation_link("New post", ["posts/new", "posts/create"], nil, new_post_url) %>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
